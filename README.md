# 🚀 React Form Handling using useState and Props

📌 This project demonstrates how to handle forms in a React application using the `useState` hook and props for state management and data flow.

---

## 🌟 Overview

In this example, we create a simple form that captures user input and manages the form state using React's `useState` hook. The form data is then passed to child components via props, showcasing effective parent-child communication in React.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ **useState Hook**: Manage form state efficiently within functional components.
✅ **Props**: Pass data and event handlers to child components to handle user input and form submission.
✅ **Controlled Components**: Implement form elements whose values are controlled by React state.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── FormComponent.js
│   └── DisplayComponent.js
├── App.js
└── index.js
```

📌 **FormComponent.js**: Contains the form and manages input state using `useState`.
📌 **DisplayComponent.js**: Receives form data via props and displays it.
📌 **App.js**: Parent component that holds the main state and handles data flow between `FormComponent` and `DisplayComponent`.

## 🎯 Usage

- ✍ **Filling the Form**: Enter data into the form fields. As you type, the state updates accordingly.
- 📤 **Form Submission**: Upon submitting the form, the data is passed to the `DisplayComponent` and rendered on the screen.
